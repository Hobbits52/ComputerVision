There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Summary ##

teacher's pet is a revolutionary app that allows you to take a picture of a multiple choice test and know your results instantly

## Features 

* Students can use our student mobile app to take a picture of their test 
* Teachers can use our teacher mobile app to take a picture of another student's test or an answer key
* Web app displays results of all students' results
* Web app performs advanced analytics to help you build better tests

## Problem ##

Teachers’ jobs are tough enough. Not only do they have the huge responsibility of teaching their students new concepts every day, but they also need to grade all their students’ homework, projects, and tests. Grading a test, especially a scantron test, should be one of the easiest tasks: compare the student’s answers with a key. Unfortunately, even this seemingly simple task can take a lot of time: you must buy special scantrons that match the scantron reader, make special trips to the scantron reader after every test, and extract the data from this special machine. Even worse, what if the scantron machine breaks? Why should teachers be expected to manually input these entries?

## Solution ##

That’s where our app teacher’s pet comes in. It allows for the instant grading of a multiple choice test. Simply ask students at the end of their tests to take a picture with their phone. Using OpenCV, data will be extracted from the image, and the results for each student will be posted on your teacher dashboard. It’s that simple.

## Customer Quote ##

"teacher's pet has made my life so much easier. All I have to do is ask my students to take a picture of their test after they're finished, and BAM, instant results! We have used this tool to instantly see class averages so that we can have a real-time discussion about results. I have actually learned to make better, more balanced tests with this! Thanks teacher's pet!" - Elizabeth Tang, Biology Teacher

"As a student, I love that my teacher uses this app. I like knowing my results right away so I don't have to worry about my peformance for the rest of the day. My teacher also uses it to instantly pinpoint concepts that the majority of students aren't understanding." - Timothy Johnson, Biology Student
